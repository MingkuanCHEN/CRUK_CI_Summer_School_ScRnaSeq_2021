## Single Cell RNAseq Analysis Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/workflow.svg')
```

## Trajectory Inference 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/trajectory.png')
```

* Cells that differentiate display a continuous spectrum of states
  
  + Transcriptional program for activation and differentiation
  
* Individual cells will differentiate in an unsynchronized manner
  
  + Each cell is a snapshot of differentiation time
  
* Pseudotime â€“ abstract unit of progress

  + Distance between a cell and the start of the trajectory
  
## Should you run trajectory inference? 

* Are you sure that you have a developmental trajectory?

* Do you have intermediate states?

* Do you believe that you have branching in your trajectory?

* Be aware, any dataset can be forced into a trajectory without any biological meaning!

* First make sure that gene set and dimensionality reduction captures what you expect. 

## Trajectory Inference Methods

* Saelens et al. (2019) Nature Biotechnology

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/saelens.png')
```

## Which method to use? 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/trajectory_2.png')
```

## Diffusion Maps (in brief)

* It is a NON-LINEAR method of dimensionality reduction.

* The distances between points are measured as probability from going from one to another.

* The data must present connectivity (transitional cells).

## Final Considerations 

* In reality, distance in multidimensional space reflects difference in transcriptional landscape, not actual time.

* Necessary to have a continuum of states among your cells (Will not work well with 2 distinct clusters) 

* May work with single time-point if ongoing differentiation process (It is better to have multiple experimental time points) 

* Be aware, any dataset can be forced into a trajectory without any biological meaning!
